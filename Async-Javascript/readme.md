# JavaScript Asynchronicity Behavior in Three Ways

JavaScript exhibits asynchronous behavior in several ways:

1. **Callback Functions:** Callback functions are a traditional approach to handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. You pass a function as an argument to another function and call it when the operation is completed.

2. **Promises:** Promises provide a more structured way to work with asynchronous operations. They represent a value that might not be available yet but will be at some point in the future. Promises can be resolved (fulfilled) or rejected, and you can attach `.then()` and `.catch()` handlers to handle the results or errors when the promise settles.

3. **Async and Await Keywords:** The `async` and `await` keywords were introduced to simplify asynchronous code even further. An `async` function returns a promise implicitly, and you can use the `await` keyword within an `async` function to pause execution until a promise is resolved. This makes asynchronous code look more synchronous and easier to read.

These three approaches allow developers to manage asynchronous tasks in JavaScript effectively, depending on their preference and the complexity of the code.
